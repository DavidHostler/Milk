This is my attempt at implementing a GAN to optimize video streaming data in the chrome browser. The lack of bandwidth during the pandemic due to stay at home policies showed the need for a cheap and easy way to improve streaming data quality. The solution may be a deep learning model trained in python, then mapped to a corresponding architecture  in the browser.
