This is my attempt at implementing a GAN to optimize video streaming data in the chrome browser. The lack of bandwidth during the pandemic due to stay at home policies showed the need for a cheap and easy way to improve streaming data quality. The solution will be a deep learning model trained in python, then mapped to a corresponding architecture  in the browser via Tensorflow.js.

Credit to Manish Dhakal for providing an excellent tutorial of the subject of super-resolution techniques in his medium article, and how to get started with it using Keras and Tensorflow.
Many other tutorials also exist, but are in Pytorch, so it's a lifesaver that he provided this since this project relies on Tensorflow.js being run tentatively in the browser. I've linked his article below for any interested parties:
