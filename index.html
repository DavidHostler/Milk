<h1>Super Resolution Model Website!</h1>

<body>

    <h3>Upload a low res image or videofile to my Express and NodeJS server,
        and it will be upscaled by a factor of 9 times its initial resolution 
        through the use of a set of neural networks referred to as a GAN, commonly also
        used for deepfakes. The GAN hallucinates what it believes a more clear version of 
        the same image should look like, and as far as the human eye can tell, she's not
        wrong!
        You can then see it on this page, and compare the before and after, provided
        that you're using chrome browser.

<h2>Technology Stack used</h2>
<p>

    The stack used for this application was fairly hefty, but allowed for me to incorporate 
    my knowledge of multiple frameworks into one full-stack application.
    
    The frontend is currently in HTML (Once I'm done with the backend server code I will recreate this page using
    ReactJS ) and the backend is a Node server running Express, and python code containing a neural network 
    constructed in Pytorch/ONNX, relying OpenCV and Pillow for the data pipeline used to parse video into image,
    feed these images to the neural network, and reconstruct the outputs of the neural network back into a video.
    ExpressJS allowed me to display both the input and upscaled videos in this browser page!
    

    If I need to, I'll incorporate either a Postgresql or MongoDB Atlas database into the backend to 
    allow the app to scale for actual user use. I also need to add a login page, because if anybody can just use 
    this app then I'm quickly going to run into server-side trouble!
